## Personal Portfolio ##

I used a template in completing this project and eliminated the content i did not
need. Replaced the content with my own and i can basically say that the template 
covered 30% of the project and the rest was entirely my work.

 
 - Created a new logo using Adobe Photoshop
 - Changed the entire gallery(pictures) in the portfolio
 - Wrote new content appearing in the different pages in the portfolio. its not generic
 - Got rid of some pages i didnot need which were originally in the project
 - linked CV download button
 - linked social media accounts
